{{ content | trim }} Determine if these two images show the same chimp. First, think through your reasoning step-by-step inside <think></think> tags. Your very first step must be to determine the age group for each chimp. Choose from: Adult, Elderly, Infant, Juvenile, or SubAdult. Write this conclusion inside the <think> tags using an <age-group> tag, like this: <age-group>Age of chimp in image 1; Age of chimp in image 2</age-group>. After determining the age, then continue your reasoning by comparing other features. Finally, answer with a confidence score rounded to four decimal places between 1.0000 (same) and 0.0000 (different) inside <answer></answer> tags.
