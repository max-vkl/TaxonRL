{{ content | trim }} Determine if these two images show the same chimp. Answer with a confidence score rounded to four decimal places between 1.0000 (same) and 0.0000 (different). First, think through your reasoning in <think></think>, then provide your conclusion in <answer></answer>. Inside <think>, FIRST identify the age group of each chimp (Image 1 and Image 2). Choose exactly one label per image from: Adult, Elderly, Infant, Juvenile, SubAdult. As the first line inside <think>, include an <age-group> tag with your intermediate decision in this exact format: <age-group>Image1={LABEL1}; Image2={LABEL2}</age-group>. After the <age-group> tag, continue your reasoning by comparing other features, then output the final score in <answer>.
